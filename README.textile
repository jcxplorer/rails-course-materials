h1. Rails Course Materials

These are materials and slide which are currently being prepared for a three day Ruby on Rails course.  All the material here is still under development, so I wouldn't use any of it just yet and it may contain serious errors.

h2. Slidedown

We use "Slidedown":http://github.com/nakajima/slidedown to generate the slides.

You can regenerate all the slide by running rake in the root directory of the project.

At the moment you need to have our "custom version of slidedown":http://github.com/k33l0r/slidedown to generate the slides as we use our own template.
