h1. Ruby Block Exercises


h2. 1. Iterate through an array

Given an array of city names:

cities = ['helsinki', 'tokio', 'johannesburg']

Use the each block to capitalize each city name:

cities.each do |city|
  city.capitalize!
end

What is the significance of using the "bang" method (.capitalize!) with the exclamation mark?


h2. 2. Upper Case Names

Create an array of four names and use the each block to print out each name in upper case.

Do not modify the original array and use the online Ruby documentation (http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/) to find out how to convert strings to upper case.
