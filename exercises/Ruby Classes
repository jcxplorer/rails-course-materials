h1. Ruby Class Exercises

h2. 1. Create a Food class with one attribute, "delicious", and an initializer to set that attribute:

class Food
  attr_accessor :delicious

  def initialize(delicious=true)
    self.delicious = delicious
  end
end

Now add another attribute, "name", and extend the initializer to include the new attribute.

h2. 2. Create a new class, "Lunch", which inherits from the food class. 

Add a new attribute, "Price" to the Lunch class.

class Lunch < Food
  attr_accessor :price
end

h2. 3. Overrides

What happens when you call to_s on an instance of the Lunch class?

Now define the to_s method in the lunch class to output a string, for example: "Lasagne, delicious: true, 12â‚¬"
